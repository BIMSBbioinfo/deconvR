The **deconvR** package designed for analyzing deconvolution of the bulk
sample(s) using an atlas of reference signature profiles and a user-selected
model (non-negative least squares regression, support vector regression,
quadratic programming, or robust linear regression). Users can upload or expand
their own reference atlases using the `findSignatures` function, or they can
choose to use the reference atlas provided in the package. `simulateCellMix`
function included to simulate a bulk signature profile of a given size.
Additionnaly, `BSmeth2Probe` function can be used to map methylation data to
probe IDs.

The **deconvR** package can be installed from Bioconductor with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("deconvR")
```

You can also install the development version of the **deconvR**  directly from
GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("BIMSBbioinfo/deconvR")
```

## How to Use deconvR
User who wish to expand their own reference atlas can use `findSignatures`
function. `atlas` is the signature matrix to be extended and `samples` the new
data to be added to the signature matrix. `atlas` and `samples` are compliant
with the function requirements. After providing appropriate `atlas` format,
users can create `samples` using `simulateCellMix` function. You can get much more
information from [here.](http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/deconvR/)
