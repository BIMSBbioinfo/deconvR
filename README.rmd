The package contains the function "deconvolute" which takes in
a reference atlas (defaults to ref_atlas included in package), a bulk sample(s) signature profile,
and the desired model to be used (non-negative least squares regression, support vector regression,
quadratic programming, or robust linear regression). The desired model will be used in conjunction with
the reference atlas in order to predict the cell origin profiles of the bulk sample(s).
The partial R-squared values of the model are also printed upon completion. Also included is the function
simulateCellMix, which can be used to simulate a bulk signature profile of a given size, using a given
reference atlas (again defaults to ref_atlas included in package). The outputted table of bulk samples
is compatible to be used as the bulk input for deconvolute. Also included is BSmeth2Probe, which can be
used to map WGBS methylation data to probe IDs. The output dataframe of BSmeth2Probe can be used for
the bulk sample methylation profile of deconvolute. Also included is findSignatures, which can create
or extend a reference atlas containing signatures of cell types.

## Installation
